## Why We're Building This

Picture this: April 11, 2025. Thousands of Jennifer Lopez fans in Kazakhstan hit refresh at 11 AM sharp. The moment tickets go on sale—complete system failure. TicketOn, controlling 90% of the country's market, couldn't handle the load from just 25,000 tickets going on sale. For 4 hours, the platform was essentially dead, with fans stuck in frozen virtual queues.

This happens everywhere. When Taylor Swift announced her tour, Ticketmaster got hit with 3.5 billion requests—four times their previous peak—and the entire platform collapsed. They had to cancel the general public sale entirely. In India, BookMyShow crashed within 10 minutes when 13 million Coldplay fans tried to buy 178,000 tickets. That's a platform failing at a 1.3% success rate.

The Kazakhstan incident revealed just how bad it is: TicketOn's CEO admitted they created "a mass of incorrectly booked orders" with "high risk of duplicate sales." Their system was so overwhelmed they had to stop everything and spend all night manually reviewing transactions. People got charged for tickets that didn't exist. Yet despite threatening $31 million worth of events, the company faced zero consequences.

These platforms run on infrastructure from another era—built for moderate traffic, not millions of simultaneous users. When your system crashes at the exact moment it's needed most, that's not a bug, it's architectural failure. Most of the current ticketing platforms simply can't scale.
